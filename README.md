Image Colorization [Grayscale to RGB] using GANs : Image Colorization is a imagetoimage generation method where the Grayscale images gets converted into colorized[RGB] images by the implementation of 'CGAN :: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)'.
 Some of the modules used for the implementation are :: PIL, TensorFlow, Keras, matplotlib .
